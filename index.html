        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: white;">Here are all the tailed beasts in Naruto, as well as the jinchuriki who carried them. The world of Naruto is
            full of flashy chakra blasts and monstrous summons, but one of Masashi Kishimoto's more inventive concepts
            were the bijuu, or tailed beasts. These creatures originate from the chakra trees of the villainous
            Otsutsuki clan, which transform into incredibly powerful ten-tailed monsters. In order to avert widespread
            destruction, the Sage of Six Paths split the ten-tails brought to Earth into nine smaller creatures, which
            would go on to become the fabled tailed beasts of Naruto.
            <br>
            These creatures either roam the land as wild, untamed demons, or are used as weapons of war by the various
            ninja villages, maintaining the balance of power between nations. In order to harness the immense power held
            within each of the bijuu, the beasts would often be contained within a human host, known as a jinchuriki.
            The joining of human and beast would create a symbiotic relationship between the two. Some pairings were
            harmonious and respectful, others only emphasized the servitude of the tailed beasts and turned them against
            humanity. Depending on the skill of the jinchuriki, the creature's power could be drawn out in battle, but
            loss of control would result in the beast escaping its human cell and going on a rampage.</p>

        <h1>GALLERY</h1>
        <p>Although Naruto and the Nine-Tails are naturally the most prominent bijuu and jinchuriki tandem in the
            series, Kishimoto gradually introduces the full set, who become more important late in the story. As
            Naruto's tailed beast lore got more complex, the anime series released a devilishly catchy "Bijuu Counting
            Song" to help fans remember the basics, which is well worth checking out for comedy value alone. These are
            all the tailed beasts of Naruto.</p>
